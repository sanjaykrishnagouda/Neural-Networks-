# Neural-Networks-

For the file 'nn_tf_multilayer.py'

Using tensorflow, applied various neural network architectures on MNIST data to perform multiclass classification. 
Some results included in text files. 
This code was compiled and tested on python 3.6 64bit (anaconda3) on windows 10. To run, simply call python filename.py.

You may edit the code to: 

use/add other optimization functions
use alternative cost functions, classifiers.
change the parameters (learning rate, etc.)

To change number of hidden layers etc : 

add more layers under the line 22 and make changes in definitions of :
weights (line 47)
biases (line 56)
nn(X) (function defined at line 68)

For using different cross entropy loss functions change line 92 accordingly.
